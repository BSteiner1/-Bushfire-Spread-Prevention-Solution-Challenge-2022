To run this yourself, the only changes that need to be made are the paths of locally-stored files

These occur in:

- Line 32: create a .csv file that will store tweets and replace with the path of that file
- Line 41: save training data which can be found on main branch (called "Inputted Target Dataset.csv") and change path
- Line 51: same path as in Line 32
- Line 65: create a new .csv file that we will use NLP on
- Line 81: save list of Australian towns which can be found on main branch (called "Australian Towns.csv") and change path
- Line 208: change path to same as in previous step for .csv file with town information
- Line 237: create an HTML file in Notepad (or any other app compatible with HTML) called Map.html
